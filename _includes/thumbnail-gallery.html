  <!--  In this code:
  
      The x-data directive is initializing an Alpine.js component with a data object that has one property: mainImage. This property is initially set to the URL of the first image in the page.gallery array.
  
      The :style directive is binding the style attribute of the div tag to a string of CSS that uses the mainImage property. This means that the style attribute will dynamically update to reflect the current value of mainImage.
  
      The @click directive is adding a click event listener to the div tag. When the div is clicked, it sets the mainImage property to the URL of the clicked image.
  
      This is a very basic example and doesn't include any transitions or animations. You might want to add those for a smoother user experience.
